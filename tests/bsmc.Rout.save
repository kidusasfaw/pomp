Welcome to pomp version 1.19!
pomp version 2 is now available on https://kingaa.github.io/pomp/.
This new version contains many improvements but is not backward compatible.
To allow users time to modify their codes, 'pomp' version 2 will be provided as package 'pomp2' for a short while.

Around the middle of 2019, 'pomp2' will be renamed 'pomp' version 2.1 and will be released to CRAN. Until then, 'pomp' versions < 2 will continue to be available.

See the 'pomp version 2 upgrade guide' at https://kingaa.github.io/pomp/.
